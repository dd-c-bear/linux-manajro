 My name is **Ryan** and I'm Grade 10 student at Dongzhimen High School.I'm a optimistic person and I like reading and skiing.  
   Sometimes I speak directly so it maybe makes you uncomfortable,I'm sorry for that.  
     I often ask questions,I'm curious about everything.My favourite subject is organisms.  
     I plan to become an doctor in the future.
